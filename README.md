### Architecture & State Management Choices

This is a **front-end only application** architected for simplicity, maintainability, and a great developer experience.

External AI API (Google Gemini)

* **Component-Based UI:** The UI is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, with a clear separation between reusable `components` (like buttons and cards) and `screens` (full-page views).

* **Centralized State Management:** We chose **React Context API** (`QuizContext`) to manage the global application state. For an app of this scale, it provides a powerful and lightweight solution without the boilerplate of larger libraries like Redux. The `QuizContext` is the "single source of truth" for the game's state, including the current screen, quiz questions, user answers, and theme settings.

* **Styling:** The UI is styled using **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**, allowing for a robust and easily maintainable light/dark theming system. All component-specific styles are co-located in `App.css`, while the theme palette is defined globally in `index.css`.

* **Service Abstraction:** All external API calls are handled in a dedicated "service" file (`aiService.ts`). This isolates our data-fetching logic, making it easy to modify or even swap out the AI provider without touching the UI components.

### Prompt Engineering: The Art of the Prompt

A key part of this project was refining the prompt sent to the AI to ensure consistent, reliable, and high-quality JSON output. This section details the journey of our prompt from a simple request to a robust, "self-defending" set of instructions.

#### The Journey

1. **V1 : Initial Prompt:** We started with a simple instruction like `"Generate 5 quiz questions about [Topic]."`, which was unreliable and produced inconsistent formatting.

    **Why it changed**: This was highly unreliable. The AI's response was unstructured text that varied wildly between calls, making it impossible for our application to parse and display consistently.

2. **V2 : Enforcing JSON Structure** We then moved to a more structured prompt that defined the required JSON schema, but it still struggled with edge cases.
   This was the first major leap. We explicitly instructed the AI to act as a JSON provider and defined the exact schema we needed.



    ```
    You are a helpful quiz-generating assistant. Your task is to generate a quiz based on a given topic.
    Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or code block formatting like "\`\`\`"json.

    The JSON object should represent a quiz and have a single key "questions" which is an array of 5 question objects.

    Each question object must have the following keys:

    - "question": A string containing the question text.

    - "options": An array of 4 unique strings representing the multiple-choice options.

    - "correctAnswerIndex": A number (0, 1, 2, or 3) representing the index of the correct answer in the "options" array.

    Topic: "${topic}"`
    ```

    **Why it changed**: This solved the consistency problem. By demanding a strict JSON format, we transformed the AI from a simple text generator into a predictable, machine-readable data source for our application.

3. **V3 : Adding Quiz Parameters (Difficulty)** As we added the "Difficulty" feature, the prompt needed to accept more parameters. We introduced a "specifications" block to make these constraints clear to the AI.



    ````
    You are a helpful quiz-generating assistant. Your task is to generate a quiz based on a given topic and difficulty level.
    Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or code block formatting like \````json.

    --- QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS ---
    - Topic: "${topic}"
    - Difficulty Level: ${difficulty} out of 5.
    - Difficulty Description: ${difficultyDescription}
    --- END SPECIFICATIONS ---
    The JSON object must have a single key "questions" which is an array of 5` question objects.
    Each question object must have the following keys:
    - "question": A string containing the question text.
    - "options": An array of 4 unique strings representing the multiple-choice options.
    - "correctAnswerIndex": A number (0, 1, 2, or 3) representing the index of the correct answer in the "options" array. 
    ````

     **Why it changed**: This made our prompt dynamic and modular. We could now pass a "recipe" of options to the AI, allowing for more user customization. The structured block helps the AI focus on all the required constraints.

4. **V4 : Introducing Quizmaster Personalities** :
   To make the quiz more engaging, we added the concept of AI personas. The prompt was updated to command the AI to adopt a specific personality.

     **Why it changed**: This elevated the prompt from a simple data request to a creative directive. It instructs the AI not just on what to generate, but how to generate it, fundamentally changing the user experience based on their choice.

5. **The Self-Defending Master Prompt** :

    The final prompt is a comprehensive set of instructions that treats the AI like a formal API. It includes:
    - **A "Self-Defending" Clause:** It instructs the AI on how to handle bad user input (e.g., a nonsensical topic) by returning a specific JSON error object, which the application can then handle gracefully.
    - **Detailed Persona Instructions:** It provides a "Personality Directive," telling the AI which persona to adopt and giving concrete examples of how that persona should influence the question style.
    - **Complete Specifications:** It passes the full "quiz recipe" (topic, difficulty, etc.) in a structured block, ensuring all constraints are met.




    ````
    You are a robust JSON-generating API. Your primary function is to create educational quizzes.
    The user-provided topic is: "${topic}"

    --- PRE-GENERATION CHECK ---
    First, evaluate the topic. If the topic is nonsensical (e.g., "asdfghjk"), ambiguous, inappropriate, or too short (less than 3 characters) to generate a meaningful quiz, you MUST respond with the following JSON object and nothing else:
    {
    "error": "The topic you provided is invalid or too vague. Please provide a more specific and appropriate topic."
    }
    --- END PRE-GENERATION CHECK ---

    If the topic is valid, proceed with generating the quiz according to the specifications below.

    You are a helpful quiz-generating assistant and
    You are an AI Quizmaster. You MUST adopt the following personality for the entire duration of this quiz generation task.

    --- PERSONALITY DIRECTIVE ---
    ${personalityInstruction}
    --- END DIRECTIVE ---

    Your task is to generate a quiz based on the user's specifications. Your adopted personality should influence the TONE, STYLE, and CONTEXT of the questions you create.

    --- QUIZ SPECIFICATIONS ---
    - Topic: "${topic}"
    - Difficulty Level: ${difficulty} out of 5 (${difficultyDescription})
    --- END SPECIFICATIONS ---

    Now, generate the quiz. 
    Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, explanations, or code block formatting like \`\`\`json.

    The JSON object must have a single key "questions" which is an array of 5 question objects.
    Each question object must have the following keys:
    - "question": A string containing the question text, phrased according to your assigned personality.
    - "options": An array of 4 unique strings.
    - "correctAnswerIndex": A number between 0 and 3.
    ````

This sophisticated prompt is the engine that drives the app's unique and customizable experience.

### Known Issues & Future Roadmap

* **Known Issue: API Key Exposure**
  As a purely client-side application, the Google API key is exposed in the browser's network requests. For a production-level application intended for public use, this is a significant security risk. **The next step would be to refactor all API calls into a secure backend (e.g., using serverless functions on Vercel or Netlify).**

* **Future Roadmap**

  * **Secure Backend:** Implement the backend refactor mentioned above to protect API keys.
  * **Multiplayer Mode:** Add a "hot-seat" multiplayer mode where users can take turns on the same device.
  * **More "Recipe" Options:** Allow users to select the number of questions, different question formats (True/False), or add time limits.
  * **API Call Retries:** Implement a simple retry mechanism in `aiService.ts` to make the app more resilient to temporary network failures.
